# noteapplication
Docker application with mobile FE

The aim of this project is a very basic notes application, set up using Docker. This repo will contain code for: <br />
<li>a Kotlin front end</li>
<li>a Flutter front end</li>
<li>an API built in Node.js</li>
<li>an OAuth authentication server built in C# .NET</li>
<li>a backend Postgres database with a corresponding admin console, and </li>
<li> a docker-compose file to set up the elements of the application.
<p>
Instructions for use:
run docker-compose up in the /backend directory to set up the services, and then run the kotlin/flutter code in the /frontend directory.
</p>
